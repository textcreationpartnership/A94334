         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The la≈øt I wrote was by a Mini≈øter to Captaine <hi>Moulton,</hi> who ≈øet ≈øaile out of <hi>Milford Haven</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> and was bound for <hi>England</hi> about the tenth of <hi>August</hi> la≈øt; I doubt not but tho≈øe lines inclo≈øed, to a Gentlewoman came to your hands, ≈øince that time our de≈øigne is changed, the Lord hath beene plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed to di≈øpo≈øe other wayes of us, our Ship is hired by Captaine <hi>Richard Swanley</hi> Admirall of the <hi>Iri≈øh</hi> Seas, for the Service of the State, we were by him imployed the 20. of <hi>September,</hi> and pre≈øently ≈øent to <hi>Duncanon</hi> Ca≈øtle neere <hi>Waterford</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> there we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued about thirty dayes, pa≈ø≈øing through many dangers, our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies lying on every ≈øide of us, ready to ≈øinke us by day, and fire us by night, if the Lord had not bin on our ≈øide we had bin de≈øtroyed: He who hath promi≈øed to be with his People when they pa≈ø≈øe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the waters, and walke through the fire, hath gratiou≈øly prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us out of the mouthes of Lyons, for ≈øuch indeed are our impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Enemies, who have left no ≈øtone unturned to worke our over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw. They are <hi>Jri≈øh</hi> and <hi>Dunkerkers,</hi> who often have ≈øet ≈øayle in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:112037:4"/>darke nights, come up by us, and fired many Gunnes upon us, but ble≈ø≈øed be God we lo≈øt little on our parts, we have ≈øhot them tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough and through, but ≈øunke none of them as we know of yet; we had onely the Fort of <hi>Duncanon</hi> our freind, where I found the old Lord <hi>E≈ømund,</hi> who maintains the Fort with two hundred men, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the whole Province of <hi>Lin≈øter,</hi> my Lord of <hi>E≈ømund</hi> and his Chaplaine refu≈øe to take the Covenant, but the Captaine of the Ca≈øtle and all the Souldiers have freely taken it, I doubt not of their reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. They wanted victualls, bread, and pea≈øe, and my Captaine hath ≈øupplied them ≈øufficiently, untill more expected provi≈ø≈øions come to them from our Admirall in <hi>Milford-Haven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From the River of <hi>Waterford,</hi> we came to the Harbour of <hi>Corke, Octob.</hi> 23. and the la≈øt Sabbath, by the de≈øire of my Captaine, I went in our Pinnace to the City of <hi>Corke,</hi> where through the importunity of my Lord <hi>Inchequin,</hi> I preached in the afternoone, on <hi>Monday</hi> morning my Lord furni≈øhed me with one of his Hor≈øes, and we rode together with the Governour of the City, to our Ship, riding then about twelve miles from <hi>Gorke,</hi> my Captaine entertayned my Lord very generou≈øly, and all his attendants, with variety of cheare and triumph, of firing Ordnance.</p>
               <p>My Lord <hi>Inchequin</hi> hath given good te≈øtimonies of his reality to the Parliament in <hi>England,</hi> he hath about twelve hundred Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/> Souldiers, above ≈øixe hundred of them have taken the Covenant, the re≈øt mu≈øt, or el≈øe ≈øoone be ca≈øhiered the Army, all Papi≈øts, and almo≈øt all the Iri≈øh, are excluded the City; the Governour thereof, Captaine <hi>Bani≈øter,</hi> is a very hone≈øt godly man, who is a very great and good a≈øsi≈øtant to my Lord: I doubt not, but they will prove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruments of much good, in carrying on that noble and pious worke begun by them, in this poore, di≈øtre≈ø≈øed, and bleeding Kingdome of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> have ≈øent three Ships laden with Provi≈øions to <hi>Corke,</hi> otherwi≈øe they might have fami≈øhed long ≈øince, they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived nothing as yet from the Parliament, I hope they will ≈øoone ≈øend a ≈øupply.</p>
               <p>This Bearer, Captaine <hi>Walker,</hi> is imployed in this Expedition, by my Lord <hi>Inchequin,</hi> for this very purpo≈øe. My Captaine hath furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhed <hi>Corke</hi> with ≈øeven Barrells of Powder, many Muskets, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nece≈ø≈øaries, out of his owne Ship-≈øtore.</p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:112037:4"/>
               <p>One thing is very remarkable in <hi>Corke:</hi> I found two hone≈øt Deanes, and an old Bi≈øhop, ≈øomwhat well-affected to the Parliament in <hi>England;</hi> the Deanes are well contented to loo≈øe their Titles, and the Bi≈øhop to be onely Ma≈øter Bi≈øhop, this is no ≈ømall wonder as I ≈øuppo≈øe.</p>
               <p>We are at the fir≈øt opportunity of winde, to ≈øet Saile for <hi>Dunca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> and there to continue, as it is thought, for two or three Moneths.</p>
               <p>This afternoone, there came a Ship into this Harbour from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> hath brought uewes, that the Earle of <hi>E≈ø≈øex</hi> had routed the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and pur≈øued them. I hope you will ≈øoone have a full end of the Wars in <hi>England,</hi> and that the <hi>Iri≈øh</hi> Rebells will be forced to feele the weight of our <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Swords.</p>
               <p>I have no further newes to acquaint you withall, there is a Ship, that within the≈øe ten dayes (if God permit) will ≈øee Saile for <hi>Port≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> then I intend to trouble you with a few lines. And for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent I re≈øt,</p>

               <head>The News from <hi>Monmouth</hi> is this.</head>
               <p>Noble Captaine I know you expect newes, I allwayes told you, good or bad, you ≈øhould heare of it, as long as God ≈øends life and being.</p>
               <p>Now as you have heard good, accept of what plea≈øed God, wee have lo≈øt <hi>Monmouth,</hi> a con≈øiderable place, and men of quality taken Pri≈øoners there, but no que≈øtion of redemption.</p>
               <p>Our lo≈ø≈øe was 13. Peeces of Ordnance great and ≈ømall, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and match, with bullets and great ≈øhot, but few men lo≈øt, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ≈øix on either ≈øide, in all I meane to that number, all re≈øting on the bed of ≈øecurity, and carele≈øne≈ø≈øe, God mend it, we are apt to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:112037:5"/>pre≈øume: to conclude it was a great lo≈ø≈øe, and a great griefe to the Governour, he being ab≈øent, and left a better Charge.</p>
               <p>God ble≈ø≈øed me well being but four dayes before in the Towne, where I was mo≈øt forward in action and a man made choyce of for the over≈øeeing of the workes, which I did to my be≈øt endeavour.</p>
               <p>I prai≈øe God I lo≈øt nothing but Oates for my hor≈øes, but I got by the hay, for I was two hundred ≈øtrong in Lice at the lea≈øt.</p>
               <p>I was never in ≈øo ba≈øe a place in my dayes, I made a ≈øhire ≈øerve eight weekes, and dur≈øt not change, for Lice are mad at cleane Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen.</p>
               <p>Come, we are not daunted as yet, but by Gods good ble≈ø≈øing hope to recover all againe, but the waters are up there, and here to, ≈øo that there is no marching to doe good.</p>
               <p>We mu≈øt waite Gods time, or the be≈øt man may faile of his skill, I feare pre≈øumption is and was our fauit, and I beleeve no le≈ø≈øe.</p>
